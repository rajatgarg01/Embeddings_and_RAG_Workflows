## Overview
This repository includes projects that demonstrate:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combining traditional retrieval methods with generative AI to answer complex queries effectively.
- **Embeddings and Similarity Scoring**: Using vector embeddings for semantic search and calculating similarity scores between documents or queries.
- **Generative AI Integrations**: Utilizing tools like `google-generativeai` to create advanced NLP models.

These projects aim to bridge the gap between classical machine learning workflows and modern generative AI capabilities.

## Key Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation for question answering.
- Embedding-based search using cosine similarity for text/document matching.
- API integration with `google-generativeai` for creating and managing embeddings.
- Secure API key handling through Kaggle's `UserSecretsClient`.
- End-to-end pipelines for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Combines dense embeddings with generative AI models to retrieve relevant context and generate precise answers.
- Uses a two-step process:
  1. **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents using vector search.
  2. **Generator**: Generates context-aware responses based on the retrieved documents.

### 2. Embedding-Based Search
- Implements text and document similarity using pre-trained embedding models.
- Calculates similarity scores with methods like cosine similarity.
- Applications include semantic search, duplicate detection, and clustering.

### 3. Similarity Scoring
- Generates embeddings for text inputs to quantify semantic similarity.
- Evaluates scores for tasks such as recommendation systems and document ranking.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `google-generativeai`: For generative AI and embeddings.
  - `NumPy` and `pandas`: For data processing and linear algebra.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning utilities (e.g., cosine similarity).
- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebooks for execution and secure key management.
